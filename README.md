Time Series Forecasting with LSTM and GRU Neural Networks


Objective:
Develop a predictive model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural networks to forecast future values based on time series data.

Project Overview:

In this project, I designed and implemented a deep learning model for time series forecasting. The primary aim was to predict future values of a given dataset by leveraging the strengths of LSTM and GRU layers in handling sequential data. The model was developed in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, and the dataset was preprocessed using the MinMaxScaler from the scikit-learn library.
